# Hayabusa - Windows Event Log Analysis Tool

## Overview
Hayabusa is an open-source digital forensic and threat detection tool for analyzing Windows Event Logs. It uses **Sigma rule-based detection** to identify suspicious activity, making it a powerful resource for incident response, forensic analysis, and threat hunting.

## Key Features
- Parses **Windows Event Logs (EVTX)** to identify security-relevant activity.
- Uses **Sigma rules** to detect anomalies and security threats.
- Provides results in multiple formats (**CSV, JSON, Markdown**).
- Supports bulk processing of multiple EVTX files.
- Customizable detection rules to reduce false positives.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (Recommended)
- Windows or Linux OS

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the Hayabusa repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd hayabusa
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Basic Command
To scan a single EVTX file and output results:
```bash
python hayabusa.py -f C:\path\to\eventlog.evtx -o results.csv
```

### Bulk Processing
To scan all EVTX files in a folder:
```bash
python hayabusa.py -d C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs -o bulk_results.csv
```

### Filtering by Sigma Rules
To apply only specific Sigma rules:
```bash
python hayabusa.py -f C:\path\to\eventlog.evtx --rules C:\path\to\sigma-rules
```

## Forensic Use Cases
- **Threat Hunting:** Identify suspicious logins, malware execution, and privilege escalations.
- **Incident Response:** Quickly analyze large volumes of event logs.
- **Forensic Investigations:** Detect unauthorized access, persistence mechanisms, and security breaches.

## Output Formats
- **CSV**: Tabular format for spreadsheets
- **JSON**: Structured data for integration with SIEMs
- **Markdown**: Easy-to-read report generation
